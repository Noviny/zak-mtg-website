A lot of focus on Modern so far in the blog, and also just generally in magic for me. Limited needs to be also on the priority list, GP Melbourne is the biggest tournament coming up, so these two formats need to be the focus (Still modern PPTQ season).

Inadvertently reading a lot about play style here, which is really valuable. Something that stuck out to me was Reid Duke talking about how his PTQ play style of conservative and safe worked well there because it let his opponents misplay, but that he bombed his first 5 PT’s because the step up in calibre of opponent meant the conservative line wasn’t enough of a % increase to game win chances, and so his play style was failing him, where as riskier plays that might pay off grant huge advantage. Really important information to absorb I feel.

Will Jonathon is talking about Focus in the chapter I just read, definitely something I want to work on, thinking back to the last week of playing, I’ve been watching other matches at the games store while playing, or setting up and experimenting with streaming while playing on MODO. Need to set good habits there.

Results
Well “Quick MODO" last night ended up being a whole League. Actually genuinely had fun playing on MODO, which is important to acknowledge, as that’s not always the way, and given fun is the reason I’m doing this, I want to reinforce my own behaviour  on everything surrounding it, including identifying it.

Discovered a new piece of value that I’d missed before; when a <Card name="Curator of Mysteries" onMouseHover/> is on the battlefield, and a <Card name="Tolaria West" onMouseHover/> is transmuted, previously the free scry trigger in my mind has been wasted, but after scrying and seeing a <Card name="Path to Exile">path</Card> on top, I realised that if I cycled another card, I could still get it (I reaaaaally wanted it) before the shuffle from transmuting would occur, so that scry still had some value. Small, but important, percentage points. Honestly, IRL I had not been bothering with the scry in that situation, so need to amend that.

Results! Of the 8 MODO games I played with [Blue End] over the weekend, I went 6-2. Against tier 1.5+ Decks, that was 3-1. Not too bad.

| UR Wizards           | 0-2 |
| -------------------- | --- |
| Hardened Scales      | 2-1 |
| UW Control           | 2-1 |
| Traditional Affinity | 2-1 |
| Mono Green Urza      | 2-0 |
| Mono Green Devotion  | 2-1 |
| Ponza                | 2-1 |
| Bridgevine           | 1-2 |

Artifact based decks still feel good, don’t even need to draw <Card name="Stony Silence" onMouseHover/>, all the <Card name="Path to Exile" text="paths" onMouseHover/> and <Card name="Living End" text="wraths" onMouseHover/> go a long way. Bridgevine was actually a lot closer than I thought it would be (having <Card name="Surgical Extraction" onMouseHover/> over <Card name="Faerie Macabre" onMouseHover/> online would help a lot, also thinking about 3 given the prevalence of graveyard decks). Decks with a clock that play at instant speed feel like terrible match ups (UR Wizards, Spirit variants), unsure how I want to approach them in the sideboard, but I need to do something there. Can probably shave/cut <Card name="Leyline of Sanctity" onMouseHover/>? It feels like it’s only there for Burn.

----------

I want to thoroughly talk about Blue End, but I think it’s really important to understand the deck, and why I keep saying it’s bad (Note: I don’t like that language, I don’t think it’s constructive to an argument. I’m going to amend it moving forward), the context it exists in needs to be talked about first. To that end, I want to talk about my understanding of the modern metagame first.
